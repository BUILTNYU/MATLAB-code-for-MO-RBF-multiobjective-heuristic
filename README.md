# MATLAB-code-for-MO-RBF-multiobjective-heuristic
"This is a script for the MO-RBF algorithm, which is a fast RBF-based heuristic for solving k-objective optimization problems. Details of the algorithm can be found in: 

Chow, J.Y.J., Regan, A.C., 2013. A surrogate-based multiobjective metaheuristic and network degradation simulation model for robust toll pricing. Optimization and Engineering, accepted for publication. 

This script was used to test the 5 test functions discussed in sections 3.3-3.4 in the paper above, and modified to obtain the Pareto set for a robust toll pricing problem (presented in a separate teaching document)."
